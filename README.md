# Dear Hacktoberfesters

I haven't touched the project in years!
Therefore the infrastructure (travis, android api, gradle etc.) is out of date.

Before picking up any "implementation"/"new feature" issue, maybe first have a look at issues
[#18](https://github.com/raphaelmeyer/caverna/issues/14),
[#16](https://github.com/raphaelmeyer/caverna/issues/14),
[#14](https://github.com/raphaelmeyer/caverna/issues/14) and
[#13](https://github.com/raphaelmeyer/caverna/issues/13)
to bring the project up and running first.
