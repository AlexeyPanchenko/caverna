# Dear Hacktoberfesters

I haven't touched the project in years!
Therefore the infrastructure (travis, android api, gradle etc.) is out of date.

Before picking up any "implementation"/"new feature" issue, maybe first have a look at issues
[#18](https://github.com/raphaelmeyer/caverna/issues/18),
[#16](https://github.com/raphaelmeyer/caverna/issues/16),
[#14](https://github.com/raphaelmeyer/caverna/issues/14) and
[#13](https://github.com/raphaelmeyer/caverna/issues/13)
to bring the project up and running first.

However, these issues are just a loose collection of steps that might be required to get the project up to date.
Pull request do not require to solve exactly one issues.

Any pull request that only covers a small part of one or more issues, but helps to bring the project **up to date** and **running on travis** again, will have a higher probability of getting accepted.
